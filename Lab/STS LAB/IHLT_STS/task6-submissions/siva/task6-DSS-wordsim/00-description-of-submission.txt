= DESCRIPTION OF RUN =

Heuristic method which uses nouns, verbs, adjectives adverbs and numbers (identified by treetagger). Each word in s1 (the shortest sentence) is matched with a word in s2. If the lemma of the word exactly matches with another lemma in s2, similarity is one. For other words, we use distributional thesaurus to find a highest similar match. Sentence similarity is computed by taking the average similarity over all the words in s1. 

= TOOLS USED =

* Part of speech tagger
* Lemmatizer
* Distributional similarity


= RESOURCES USED =


* Other distributional similarity thesauri (ukWaC thesaurus in Sketch Engine)


= METHOD TO COMBINE TOOLS AND RESOURCES =

 The heuristic based algorithm
1) retains nouns, verbs (not be) adjectives adverbs and numbers, to sentences of remaining tokens S1 and S2 . S1 is the shortest length sentence.
2) check if a word in S1 has its exact lemma match in S2. The similarity score of the word is 1 if a match is found.
3) If exact match is not found, then the word in S1 is mapped to a word in S2 which has highest distributional similarity score between their lemmas. The similarity of the word is the distributional similarity score between the lemmas.
5) score = sum(aligned words from step 2 and 3 in S1)/ |S1|
