= DESCRIPTION OF RUN =

This run is a combination of several different tools and resources to find the
equivalence between two sentences: machine translation evaluation scores at the
lexical level, shallow parsing, deep parsing, shallow semantics, discourse
relations, word distributional similarity and word knowledge-based similarity.

= TOOLS USED =

* Part of speech tagger
* Syntax parser
* Semantic Role Labeling
* Lexical Substitution
* Distributional similarity
* Knowledge-based similarity
* Named Entity recognition

* Dependency Parser
* Stemmer

= RESOURCES USED =

* Wikipedia

= METHOD TO COMBINE TOOLS AND RESOURCES =

Machine learning approach to combine the tools and resources. The SVMLight
toolkit was used (SVM RBF kernel, default parameters).
