= TEAM =

Weiwei Guo, Columbia University

= DESCRIPTION OF RUN =

We run weighted matrix factorization for 20 iterations. 

= TOOLS USED =

* Part of speech tagger
* Lemmatizer
* Distributional similarity

= RESOURCES USED =

* Monolingual corpora
* WordNet (However, we only use the sense definitions.  We treat each sense definition as a document.  We use WordNet definitions as a monolingual corpora.  We did not use the sense information such as synonymy...)
* Wiktionary {Same as WordNet.  Also we did not link the senses in WordNet and Wiktionary}

= METHOD TO COMBINE TOOLS AND RESOURCES =

We use weighted matrix factorization as an approach to extract latent semantics of a sentence by explicitly modeling missing words.  This method is in the same category of LSA, LDA.  We did not use any knowledge based resources.
