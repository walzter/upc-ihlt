Stanford NLP. Mengqiu Wang

= DESCRIPTION OF RUN =

We used a edit-distance based probabilistic finite state machine model for
this task. Our model is trained with a regression target to optimize human
evaluation score. It has a log-linear parameterization and thus capable of
modeling linguistic phenomena such as paraphrasing, synonyms and dependency
structure matching.
We used all the combined training data to train one joint model and make
prediction for each subtask using the same model.

= TOOLS USED =

[Please keep those tools that you used, delete those you did not use, and add more lines if needed]

* Part of speech tagger
* Lemmatizer
* Multiword expressions recognition
* Syntax parser
* Lexical Substitution

= RESOURCES USED =

[Please keep those resources that you used, delete those you did not use, and add more lines if needed]

* Tables of paraphrases
* WordNet

= METHOD TO COMBINE TOOLS AND RESOURCES =

We use machine learning techniques to train a regression model and
automatically learn feature weights for combining these linguistic resources


= COMMENTS =

This model was originally developed for machine translation evaluation, and we
did not make any sense-eval specific adjustment or optimization. Ideally in
the future we would like to experiment with more features and include more
resources to better capture semantic equivalence.
