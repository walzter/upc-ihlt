= DESCRIPTION OF RUN =

The method combines n-gram based similarity and semantic (conceptual) similarity.
N--gram based similarity is calculated using a method that attempts
to find the longest n-grams shared by a pair of sentences and assigns them a
weight based on the idf scores of each of the composing words.
Conceptual similarity is calculated between concepts in different sentences.
WordNet is used to calculate similarity, with ProxyGenea3 as similarity
measure. We retain the highest similarity value found for each concept
between the two sentences.

= TOOLS USED =

* Part of speech tagger
* Knowledge-based similarity
* N-gram based similarity

= RESOURCES USED =

* WordNet
* Google Web 1T

= METHOD TO COMBINE TOOLS AND RESOURCES =

We used the Part-Of-Speech by the Stanford NLP Group which is based on Conditional Random Fields.
WordNet and the Google Web 1T collection were used in the knowledge-based similarity and
n-gram based similarity calculation process, heuristically (no learning involved).
