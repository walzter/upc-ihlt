= DESCRIPTION OF RUN =

This run is based on distributional similarity computed relying on a WordSpace. 
WordSpace is a vector space in which words are represented as mathematical points.
The exploited WordSpace is built using Random Indexing and Latent Semantic Analysis. 
In particular, Latent Semantic Analysis is performed on the output space generated by the Random Indexing. 
We adopt WaCkypedia_EN as corpus.

= TOOLS USED =

* Distributional similarity

= RESOURCES USED =

* Monolingual corpora

= METHOD TO COMBINE TOOLS AND RESOURCES =

The distributional similarity is based on vectors sum. 
The meaning of a text is computed as the vector sum of all the words which occur in. 
Then, each text is represented by a vector. 
The similarity between two texts is defined as the cosine between their vector representation.
