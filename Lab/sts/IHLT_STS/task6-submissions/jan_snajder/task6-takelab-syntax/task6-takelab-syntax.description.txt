= DESCRIPTION OF RUN =
Run 2: Lexical semantics + syntax + NERC

This run was performed using dictionary based lexical semantics features, distributional lexical semantics features, syntax overlap features and named entity overlap features.
SVM (libSVM) was used for training and predicting.   

= TOOLS USED =

* Part of speech tagger
* Lemmatizer
* Stemmer
* Syntax parser
* Lexical Substitution
* Distributional similarity
* Knowledge-based similarity
* Named Entity recognition

= RESOURCES USED =

* Monolingual corpora
* WordNet

= METHOD TO COMBINE TOOLS AND RESOURCES =

Supervised machine learning, support vector machines. The libSVM library was used.

= COMMENTS =

Not sure if the typos were intentional, but the labels in the gold sets were not reflecting them (i.e., people would recognize a typo and ignore it when assessing the similarity).
We don't think this kind of task should include spelling correction, instead the teams should focus on similarity itself.
