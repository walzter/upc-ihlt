= DESCRIPTION OF RUN =

This run is based on distributional similarity computed relying on a WordSpace. 
WordSpace is a vector space in which words are represented as mathematical points.
In particular, the WordSpace is built using a technique based on Random Indexing and vectors permutation. 
Permutation is used to encode syntactic dependencies between words in the WordSpace. 
We adopt WaCkypedia_EN as corpus which contains full dependency parse performed by MaltParser.

= TOOLS USED =

* Distributional similarity

= RESOURCES USED =

* Monolingual corpora

= METHOD TO COMBINE TOOLS AND RESOURCES =

The distributional similarity is based on vectors sum. 
The meaning of a text is computed as the vector sum of all the words which occur in. 
Then, each text is represented by a vector. 
The similarity between two texts is defined as the cosine between their vector representation.
