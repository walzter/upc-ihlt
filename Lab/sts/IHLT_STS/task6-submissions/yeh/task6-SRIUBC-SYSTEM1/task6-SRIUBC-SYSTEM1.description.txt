= DESCRIPTION OF RUN =

This run incorporates the following:
- Several semantic similarity methods, based on different resource types and pooled using a Semantic Matrix (Fernando and Stevenson 2008).  The underlying resources include the WordNet Lin, WuP, and LCH WordNet similarity measures, the Lin thesaurus, and ESA over Wikipedia.  
- String edit (Levenshtein) distances, using the Semantic Matrix for pooling.
- Cosine overlap over lemmas.
- Soft BLEU score up to order 4 over lemmas.
- POS vector features, per Finch et al. (2005)
- Linear combinations of the above.

These were regressed using the LibSVM Support Vector Regression, with a CV tuned gamma of 1.0, using a radial basis kernel.

= TOOLS USED =

- Part of speech tagger
- Lemmatizer
- Distributional similarity
- Knowledge-based similarity

= RESOURCES USED =

- WordNet
- Wikipedia
- Lin's thesaurus

= METHOD TO COMBINE TOOLS AND RESOURCES =

Per the description, resource based methods (WordNet measures, Wikipedia, Lin's thesaurus) were pooled using Semantic Matrices to arrive at a number.  These, along with the POS vector features, were encoded as vectors and fed to the LibSVM Support Vector Regression package.
